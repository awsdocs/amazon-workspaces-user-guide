# WorkSpaces USB redirection<a name="usb-redirection"></a>

Universal Serial Bus \(USB\) is used to connect computers to devices, such as scanners, printers, external drives, and security keys\. PCoIP Windows WorkSpaces support redirection of a locally attached YubiKey for universal 2nd factor authentication from the Windows WorkSpaces client application\.

**Requirements**
+ USB redirection is disabled by default on Windows PCoIP WorkSpaces\. You must enable USB redirection for WorkSpaces\. You can configure USB allowed and unallowed device rules to define which devices can be redirected\. For more information, see [Manage your Windows WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/group_policy.html) 
+ Install WorkSpaces client version 4\.0 or later, with the USB redirection driver, locally\. For more information, see [ Setup and Installation\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/amazon-workspaces-windows-client.html#windows_setup)

**Supported USB devices**

Amazon WorkSpaces currently supports USB redirection only for YubiKey U2F\. Other types of USB devices might be able to be redirected\. However, they are not supported and might not work properly\. 

The following is a list of USB YubiKey models that are validated to work with the PCoIP Windows WorkSpaces redirection for U2F:
+ YubiKey 4
+ YubiKey 5 NFC
+ YubiKey 5 Nano
+ YubiKey 5C
+ YubiKey 5C Nano
+ YubiKey 5 NFC
+ Most USB type C to USB type A adapters can be used with a supported YubiKey

**Unsupported USB devices**

Control, interrupt, and bulk transfer types from USB devices are technically able to be redirected\. Most USB mass storage devices and some scanners and printers use these data transfer types\. Isochronous transfers, which are commonly used in webcams, are not supported\. Therefore, USB webcams are not supported\. 

The following USB device is validated to work with PCoIP WorkSpaces for U2F authentication, although it is not supported:
+ Thetis Security Key

The following USB device does not work with PCoIP WorkSpaces for U2F authentication:
+ Kensington Security Key

**To connect your local USB device to your WorkSpace**
**Warning**  
When you connect a local USB device to your WorkSpace, it is no longer available for use by your local computer\. For example, if you redirect your USB mouse to the WorkSpace, your computer cannot receive mouse input from the redirected USB mouse until you disconnect it from the WorkSpace\.

USB device connections do not persist across WorkSpaces streaming sessions\. You must connect your USB device each time that you connect to your WorkSpace\. Up to 10 USB devices can be redirected concurrently in a WorkSpaces streaming session\.

1. Log in to a PCoIP Windows WorkSpace using the WorkSpaces Windows client application\.

1. On the client interface, click the **Devices** icon ![\[Devices icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/images/devices-icon.png) to list the locally attached USB devices\.

1. Select the USB device and choose **Use with WorkSpaces** from the menu next to the device name\.

1. Your USB device is ready to use with your WorkSpace\.

**To disconnect your local USB device from your WorkSpace**

1. On the client interface, click the **Devices** icon ![\[Devices icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/images/devices-icon.png) to list the locally attached USB devices\.

1. Select the USB device and choose **Use with local device** from the menu next to the device name\.

1. Your USB device is ready to use with your local computer\.

**To reinstall USB redirection drivers**

If you run into issues with the USB redirection drivers, follow these steps to do a clean re\-installation of the drivers\.

1. Uninstall the USB redirection drivers by running the following command\.

   ```
   [Amazon WorkSpaces directory]\pcoipusb\bin\USB\PCoIP_Client_USB_uninstaller.exe
   ```

1. Reboot your machine\.

1. Open the **Registry Editor** editor\.

1. Under **HKLM**, search for **fusbhub**\.

1. Remove the registry key, which is the item in the left pane with the folder icon\. In this case it is the **fuhub** key, containing **fusbhub**\. If you cannot remove this registry key, make note of the \.inf file name that's associated with the registry entry\. The \.inf file name usually starts with "oem," for example "oem9\.inf"\. Open the command line \(using administrator privileges\), and run the following prompt, substituting the \.inf file name for *oem9\.inf*\.

   ```
   pnputil -f -d oem9.inf
   ```

1. Repeat step 5 until **fusbhub** is completely removed from the registry editor\.

1. Reboot your machine\.

1. After you log into your WorkSpace, select the **Devices** icon ![\[Devices icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/images/devices-icon.png), and reinstall the USB driver\. Alternatively, you can invoke the following PowerShell script \(using administrator privileges\)\.

   ```
   [Amazon WorkSpaces directory]\pcoipusb\install-pcoip-usb-driver.ps1
   ```
